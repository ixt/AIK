# Becomming an "Android Developer"

If you have access to an Android 'phone, find the "Settings" app, then the "About phone" option. Keep pressing the build number until you become
and Android developer. Go back, and the "Developer options" item will have appeared. Select it, and enable USB debugging.

Connect the 'phone to your computer via a USB lead. In the "machine" menu of your VM's window there is a "settings" option. Select it, then
the USB options. Add a device filter by clicking the icon with the small green cross on the right, and choose the device that best matches your
'phone. Disconnect and reconnect the 'phone. The "screenshot" option under "Android Device Tools" should be working, as should the options to push and pull
.apk packages to and from the device. Next stop, WireShark.
